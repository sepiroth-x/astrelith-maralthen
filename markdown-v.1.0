## 2. Core Grammar Rules

### 2.1 Sentence Structure

- **Default word order:** **Verb – Subject – Object (VSO)**  
- Articles and prepositions are **prefix-attached** to nouns (e.g., `ra` = the, `dil` = for).  
- Pronouns have short (informal) and formal variants, and all pronouns in a sentence must match in style.

### 2.2 Articles & Prepositions

| Particle | Meaning | Usage |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `ra`     | the     | Attached directly to nouns: `raAstrem` = the Master |
| `dil`    | for     | Attached to nouns, separate before pronouns: `dil turek` = for you |

### 2.3 Morphology

## 6. Question Word Placement Rule

**All question words (kith, veth, talor, xelith, morra) must appear at the end of the sentence.**

- This is a strict syntactic rule for Astrelith Maralthen.  
- The interrogative marker is the final position of the question word.  
- No inversion of word order is needed for questions.

**Examples:**
- `Morra ixra dilturek kith?` — How are you?  
- `Veloren ixra raAstrem veth?` — Where do I lead the Master?  
- `Renathen turek talor?` — When do you live?  

---

## 7. Linking Word: *saren*

- Used to connect two nouns, two verbs, or two clauses.  
- Functions similarly to English “and”.  

**Examples:**
- `RaAstrem saren raXorath` — The Master and the Throne.  
- `Ixra zorathen saren veloren` — I love and lead.

## 9. Attachment Rules

- `ra` and `dil` attach to **nouns** without a space:

- Before **pronouns**, `dil` is separate:
  - `dil turek` = for you
