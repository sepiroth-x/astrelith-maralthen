## 5. Grammar Updates: Question Words & Linking Word

### Question Words Placement

- Question words **kith (what), veth (where), talor (when), xelith (why), morra (how)** **must always appear at the end of the sentence** when used to form a question.  
- **Example:**  
  - *Morra ixra dilturek kith?* — How are you?  
  - *Veloren ixra raastrem veth?* — Where do I lead the Master?

### Linking Word

- **saren** means “and” and is used to connect nouns or clauses.  
- **Examples:**  
  - *raastrem saren raxorath* — The Master and the Throne  
  - *ixra zorathen saren veloren* — I love and lead

---

## 6. Attachment Rules & Capitalization

- `ra` (the) and `dil` (for) **must be written attached to the following noun without a space:**  
  - Examples: `raastrem` (the Master), `dilraxorath` (for the Throne)  
- When `dil` precedes a pronoun, it stands **separately:**  
  - Example: `dil turek` (for you)  
- **All concatenated words are written in lowercase except the first letter of the sentence or proper noun at the beginning:**  
  - Correct: *Raastrem saren raxorath.*  
  - Not: *RaAstrem saren raXorath.*
